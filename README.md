### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ , I am Ketaki Joshi


You can read more about me and my research on my [website](https://joshi-ketaki.github.io/).

I have interned and worked full-time at Nvidia previously, primarily on compilers and memory management. I have been a researcher at Yale building resource-efficient, adaptable, and accurate computer systems. 

Below is a collection of some of my repositories which I can make public. Note, that I have a few private repositories which include the development of a toy compiler, asynchronous system calls, etc. that were implemented when I was a Teaching Assistant or completed as assignments when I was a graduate student at Yale. These cannot be made public as these are university resources. I can share these samples on request.
